# D&D Terminal Adventure
![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ruby-CC342D?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby&logoColor=white)

**A text-based roleplaying game where you battle monsters, charm strangers, and survive perilous encounters—all from your terminal!**

## 🎲 The Idea
This is a Ruby-based terminal game inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. You play as an adventurer making choices in randomly generated scenarios, rolling virtual dice (1-20) to determine success or failure.

The core mechanics include:
- **Random scenarios** (forest encounters, mysterious strangers, treasure hunts)
- **Action-based outcomes** (fight, talk, flee, flirt, inspect)
- **Dice rolls** (success depends on difficulty level)
- **Health system** (lose HP in failed battles, game over at 0)

## ⚙️ How It Works (Current Version)
- Built in **Ruby** for a CLI experience
- Simple **random number generation** (1-20) for skill checks
- **Scenario tracking** to avoid repetition
- **Basic health system** (fight failures cost HP)

### How to Run
1. Make sure you have Ruby installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `ruby dnd_game.rb`
4. Choose actions and see if luck favors you!

## 🚀 Future Plans
I'm treating this as a learning project while making it fun. Here's what I want to add next:

### Gameplay Expansions
- **D&D 5e API integration** (monsters, spells, items)
- **Character stats** (Strength, Charisma, Dexterity—affecting rolls)
- **Inventory system** (weapons, potions, loot)
- **Leveling up** (XP gains, stat improvements)
- **Boss fights & quests** (structured challenges)

### Technical Improvements
- **Save/load system** (store progress between sessions)
- **Better UI** (ASCII art, colors, more immersive text)
- **Web version** (React.js frontend + Ruby backend)

## 💡 Why I Built This
- To **practice Ruby** in a fun way
- To **learn game logic** (random events, progression systems)
- To **eventually turn it into a web game** (React + API)
- Because **D&D is cool**, and terminal games are nostalgic
